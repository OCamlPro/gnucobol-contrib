2.02.12 No requirements for this version but a small file is now created holding
the name and license details of the pilot or crew member for the report.
It now allows you to specify that you want running grand totals to be created
after each months totals when using option D.

===============================================================================

Before 2.02.10

This flightlog update fixes some bugs and increases the size of the airfield
name from 20 characters to 36 to help cover some of the European airfields
that have longer than average names as well as
for military use (Navy) aircraft carriers.

If there is no ICAO code allocated to them or no hull code that can be
abbreviated to 4 characters say such as CUL-87 to CL87 then
create a code say starting from: Z000 or ZL00 onwards.
Correct we do not know as cannot find out but if you know and
where they are listed let us know via email.

For private airfields that also have no ICAO coding use code starting from
ZAAA for the first ZAAB 2nd etc.

If an airfield has a ICAO coding in the future you can replace the Z coding
with the correct one using menu option K for the odd one or two or
Option H for more that will change the airfield file entry and all
flights that use the old name changing to the new one, easy.

Your choice though.

--------------------------

This is for the software version v2.02.nn series that updates versions v2.01.
If you are updating from a v2.02 version you have already updated the Airfield
file so can ignore all this.


This version v2.02. requires a special program to be run before the new version
of Flightlog can be used as the airfield file has been changed.

It is important that you follow these procedures first in the given order
before compiling the new version.

READ IT ALL THROUGH FIRST, BEFORE DOING SO.

IT MUST ONLY BE DONE, ONCE.

These instructions are for Linux so modify them if using Windows.

A. Preparation for update.
   Note where you have downloaded the new flightlog version to.

   Make sure you do the following :

 1. Open the terminal program you use for flightlog
    Now change to the working directory you use for flightlog.
    E.g., cd flightlog

 2. Using your existing version of Flightlog select option S
    to create the three sequential files then exit.

    Confirm that you now have six files in the working directory =
    airfield.dat
    airfield.seq
    aircraft.dat
    aircraft.seq
    flitelog.dat
    flitelog.seq

    by using ls -la

    and that the date and time of the .seq files are a minutes or so ago.
     Just to make sure they are not old copies.

 3. Find where the flightlog program is and if not there already, copy it
    to your working directory,  you can use the command :
      whereis flightlog

      which will show you where it is. If it does not return with a location
      then you have it in the directory where you run flightlog from.

 4. Using your archiver of choice make a back up of the 6 data files AND
    the flightlog program, replacing 'yyyymmdd' with today's date so:

    Using zip do :
      zip -9 backup-v2.01-pre-update-yyyymmdd.zip *.dat *.seq flightlog

     Now test the archive
       unzip -vt backup-v2.01-pre-update-yyyymmdd.zip

   OR Using rar do :
      rar a backup-v2.01-pre-update-yyyymmdd.rar *.dat *.seq flightlog

     Now test the archive
     rar tv backup-v2.01-pre-update-yyyymmdd.rar

 5.  You can now delete the flightlog file if you copied it in step 3 ONLY by
     rm -f flightlog

 6.  Create if not already done a backup directory/folder by
     mkdir backups

 7.  Copy the archive created to the backups directory by:
     cp -vp backup-v2.01-pre-update-yyyymmdd.zip (or .rar)  backups

     Change the name of 'backups' if different to the one you use.

B.  You may want to save the current source file version of flightlog
    if you have not got the downloaded archive of it, check this now.

    You can save it in backups or create a directory in backups to
    hold the directory holding the source file along with all other
    files that came with it. Use your archiver of choice as in step 4.

    Now to work on the updated source file that came with this file:

 1. Go to the directory containing the sub directory that hold the previous
    version of flightlog and create a new directory called flightlog.2.02.00
    [  mkdir flightlog.2.02.00 ]

    Change to that directory [ cd flightlog-2.02.00 ]

    Now un archive the updated flightlog archive using
    unrar ~/Downloads/archivefilename

    or rar e ~/Downloads/archivefilename

    or unzip ~/Downloads/archiverfilename

    or tar xfvz ~/Downloads/archiverfilename
     You may have to exclude the 'z' param above if you get an error.

 2. The following assumes you installed the cobol compiler from last time so:
    run :

    cobc -x afldconv1.cbl
    cobc -x flightlog.cbl

    These should have completed with NO error or warning messages but if so find
    out why and fix the issue/s and rerun.

 3. Copy the flightlog executable to the same directory you found the previous
    one in step A.3 replacing the old version.
    Shown here, but may not be the correct location for you :
      [ cp -f flightlog ~/bin ]
     but it is the usual one for Linux based systems but yours could be
     different :)

 4. Next is running the convert program afldconv1, so now run:
    afldconv1

    The program needs file airfield.seq and creates a new airfield.dat.
     THIS REPLACES THE ORIGINAL ONE.

    The display should show each of these on their own lines near the bottom of
    screen as the number of:

    records read
    records written
      with a message "File converted" to confirm all is well.

     The values for read and written must be the same otherwise it
       indicates problems that must be resolved before continuing but
       report it as a bug / problem by email direct to vbcoen@gmail.com

 5. Assuming all is well and afldconv1 completed correctly
    you can now delete the program afldconv1 by [ rm -f afldconv1 ].

 6. Update is now complete and you can use the updated version of flightlog.


See the file README.1st if it exists, for any important last minute information.



Changelog :

 19/12/18 vbc - 2.02.00 Coding to change afld name from 20 - 36 chars.
                        Change Afld entry option K to support changed length.
                        Change Afld entry during Flight data entry/amend.

                        Tables for EBCDIC to ASCII updated for redefines.
                        Just need to add in the inspect, converting code during
                        the read of the data file. Now added - the problem will
                        be to find data to test it with. USer running CSV import
                        any one got a EBCDIC CSV data file for testing ?
                        Removed the airfield sort but kept the 'not print unused
                        aflds' facility. Sort by date just made it hard to read
                        anyway.
