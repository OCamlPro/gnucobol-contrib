A simple program to read from the current folder all source file listings that
end with .prn and count the total number of Cobol code lines.

It will ignore any secondary listing within each one that starts with 000001 as
it assumes that any such are in fact c object packs as GC lists those as well -
yes a bug in gc listing routine - must get around to reporting it.

As well as blank lines at least where the first six character only have spaces
as against a numeric value in the range - 000000 to 999999 etc as anything else
is ignored.

Note that listings containing nested program will work as the number increases
by one for the next nested program / module.

I have tested it against my ACAS accouting sources and manually checking one sub
systems folder with only 10 -12 sources and the .prn files and then running
cntlines in the same folder - was the same.

Note that cntlines must be run from the top folder holding your sources where
you have previously run cobc -x|-x progname.cbl -T progname.prn on all your
source code files that you want counted.

It only looks for files ending with .prn and only lower case.

As ACAS has scripts for compiling the system by sub system which in my case is
irs, general, purchase, sales and stock it workds as advertised. By running it
in just one lower level folder it will do the same as it issues command  -

find . -name '*.prn' | sort > cnt.tmp

Then reads the file cnt.tmp counting and searching for non number cc1-6 etc.

Easy, but why I want a total size of the applications cobol source code in
lines.

Note as is, it will not work under Windows, only *nix platforms.
