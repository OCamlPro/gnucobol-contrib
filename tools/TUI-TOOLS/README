*** GnuCOBOL TUI (TEXT USER INTERFACE) TOOLS AND UTILITIES COLLECTON ***

In this folder you will find: 
- GnuCOBOL TUI TOOLS (GC01xxxxxx to GC98xxxxxx)   
- GnuCOBOL Utilities (GC99xxxxxx) 

Although the textual interfaces TUI are often replaced by graphical interfaces GUI, 
a good compiler have to allow to develop complete applications in an easy way 
even with textual user interfaces.

GnuCOBOL have to generate applications with objects that allow a classical and 
friendly user interface like other programming languages on windows and unix platform.
here you will find a collection of GnuCOBOL programs useful to this purpose.
The TUI Collection includes programs to manage classical TUI objects like: dropdown menus, 
Buttons, YES-NO buttons, on-screen messages, boxes, checkboxes, radiobuttons, listview, 
calculator, date picker, color picker, file picker, directory tree picker and so on.
All programs have been developed exclusively using GnuCOBOL 
(pure COBOL with some direct calls to "C" funtions from PDCURSES library but without "C wrappers").
They are GnuCOBOL programs you can "CALL" from your source to manage TUI objects like 
menus, boxes, buttons, checkboxes, radiobuttons, datepicker ... and so on ... 
You can choose objects attributes: position on screen, size, colors, borders, shadows, titles, 3D effect ...
Source files are well commented. Documentation of parameters is inside the copybooks.
Each TUI TOOL have one or more corresponding demo programs to show how to use the TOOL.
The GnuCOBOL sources have been compiled with GnuCOBOL 3.1.
Mouse management was already added to some of TUI TOOLS. 
The implementation of the various Tools to add mouse management is currently underway.
Let me know if you have any suggestion or idea to improve/extend the tools.
Your suggestions will be very useful and welcome.

AUTOMATIC COPY GENERATORS
-------------------------

GC99COPYGEN.COB - Automatic COBOL Copy generator from graphic Reports layout.
Useful for cobol programs that write reports. How to use it:
1. Create a .TXT text file with the graphical layout of your report. 
Set all constants and variables: 
- use one or more $ symbol when you want a PIC X field, 
- use one or more # symbol when you want a PIC 9 field. 
For a better graphical representation of the report you can also insert 
blank lines or repeated rows equal to previous lines.
2. run the program GC99COPYGEN to read  .TXT file containing the report layout
It will create the corresponding COBOL Copy in a .CPY text file. 
The program will skip blank lines and will skip rows equals to each other, 
eg. rows with same fields, will produce a single 01 level into the copy.
3. the generated COBOL Copy should be used directly in the COBOL program 
that will produce the report, or you can change it before, 
to enhance the COBOL Copy for a better PIC editing  
of individual fields directly in the copy.
See samples at 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnucobol/discussion/contrib/thread/e21eb9ba/#90fd

GC99SCREENGEN.COB - Automatic COBOL Copy generator from graphic Screen layout.
Useful for cobol programs that use SCREEN SECTION. How to use it:
1. Create a .TXT text file with the graphical layout of the SCREEN 
(25 (or more) rows x 80 (or more) columns). 
Set all constants and variables: 
- use one or more $ symbol when you want a PIC X field, 
- use one or more # symbol when you want a PIC 9 field. 
2. Run the program GC99SCREENGEN to read the .TXT file containing the SCREEN layout
It will create the corresponding COBOL Copy in a .CPY text file. 
3. the generated COBOL Copy should be used directly in the COBOL program 
that will display / accept the SCREEN, or you can change it before, 
to enhance the COBOL Copy for a better SCREEN display of individual fields.

GC99SCREENPAINTER.COB - Uset his program to draw a 25x80 screen layout based on your needs, 
by setting constants, variable alphanumeric or numeric fields and back/foreground colors.
Upon user request it saves the screen layout to a TXT file of 25 records where each record
contains an entire 80 chars screen line with back and foreground color codes.
Upon user request this program, from the TXT file:
- automatically generates the copy for the SCREEN SECTION and for WORKING-STORAGE SECTION
  the color of a string (of spaces, constants or variables) is taken from its 1st character
- automatically generates, compile and execute a simple GnuCOBOL program to test the new SCREEN
  (you need the GnuCOBOL 3.2 or greater compiler available)
SCREEN-101.TXT contains a demo screen.
Note: at the moment a screen of 25 rows and 80 columns is supported.
