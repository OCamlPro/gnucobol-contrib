This is the Modification History (ChangeLog) for CobolMac.

Note: The items in this list are held in newest first order.

Version: B.02.00  June 2015  Robert W.Mills (robertw-mills@users.sf.net).

  - Implemented ToDo Item 5 (Preload standard macro definitions).
  - Replaced home-grown command line option processing with CBL_OC_GETOPT.
  - Added short (single character) options to go with the existing long options.
  - Updated Manual.txt and Manual.htm to reflect changes.

Version: B.01.00  May 2015  Robert W.Mills (robertw-mills@users.sf.net).

  - Removed the stdin/stdout/stderr redirection checks. This makes it more like
    other utilities in the 'POSIX world'. (BTiffin request).
  - Updated Manual.txt and Manual.htm to reflect changes.

Version: B.00.00  May 2015  Robert W.Mills (robertw-mills@users.sf.net).

  - Reorganised the working storage and code to make later changes easier.
  - Moved the macro syntax text to the CobolMac manual.
  - Implemented the $DEFINE command (see item 1 in TODO). This replaces the
    macro text held in external files with text that is defined in-line.
  - Removed the -v, -m and -x options as they are no longer required.
  - Removed the --macro option as the macro syntax is now documented in the
    CobolMac manual.
  - Renamed the -q option to --quiet.
  - Added the --hardwarn option. This causes all warnings to be treated as if
    they were fatal errors.
  - Only two status values are returned by the program:
      - 0 (zero) indicates that the program completed without any errors.
      - 1 (one) indicates that the program terminated in an error state.
          A tombstone will have been written to stderr prior to termination.
          Note: The output file, if created, is incomplete/corrupt.
  - Implemented the $INCLUDE command.

Version: A.00.00  November 2014  Robert W.Mills (robertw-mills@users.sf.net).

  - Changed version number in preperation for inital release.
  - This version was never loaded into the GnuCOBOL SVN Repository.

Version: x.00.00  May 2014  Robert W.Mills (robertw-mills@users.sf.net)

  - Start of development.
