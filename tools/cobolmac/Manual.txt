1.0 Description

  CobolMac is a COBOL Macro Preprocessor utility that reads a COBOL source file
  prior to processing by GnuCOBOL's Compiler.

  It is implemented as a command-line filter that emulates the Macro capability
  available with the Hewlett-Packard e3000 COBOL II/iX Compiler.

  It allows the user to define pre-written code which is incorporated into the
  source code. Macros can have up to nine formal parameters. In the definition
  actual parameters are supplied to replace the formal parameters when the macro
  is called in the source program.

  A good library of pre-tested Macros can greatly speed program writing, and can
  also be used to assist portability of code, with the differences between COBOL
  dialects being hidden in the Macro Definitions.

  In Don Nelson's "COBOL 85 for Programmers", he says about the COPY...REPLACING
  & REPLACE statements:

    "The rules are complex and are actually ambiguous in some cases."

  Right there, that's something of a warning, and he goes on to say much about
  behaviors to beware of. He also warns that "One problem is that only words are
  replaced, not parts of words."

  Note: If used to preprocess FIXED FORMAT files then extra care must be taken
        when defining the macros to ensure that all added code resides in the
        correct areas - Area A (cols 7 to 11) and Area B (cols 12 to 72).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Standard Macros Library

  At some point you will find yourself $DEFINEing and using a standard set of
  macros. When this happens you can add the $DEFINE commands into a file named
  'cobolmac.standard.macros' and CobolMac will automatically add it to the start
  of the source programs Working-Storage Section.

  The file cobolmac.standard.macros is assumed to reside in the current working
  directory.

  The --stdlib=filename (-s:filename) option can be used to point CobolMac to
  a shared library file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.0 CobolMac Commands

  The following commands are supported by the CobolMac Preprocessor.

  3.1 $DEFINE

    The $DEFINE command is used to define a macro. When you define a macro, you
    associate a macro name with a string of text. It has the following format:

    $DEFINE %macro-name=[string-text]#

    Parameters:

      macro-name   The name of the macro being defined. It consists of an
                   initial percent sign, %, followed by an alphabetic character,
                   followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters.

                   The length of the macro name may be up to 70 characters long.

      string-text  Can be any text you choose. However, because this text is
                   sent to the compiler, it must be a valid COBOL statement or
                   sentence, with one exception. This exception is the use of
                   formal parameters in the string-text. Formal parameters are
                   described later in this section.

    Description:

      Note that string-text is delimited by an equal sign and a hash, '#', sign.
      The hash sign is the delimiter of the entire definition.

      Nested $DEFINE commands and recursive macros are not supported.

      You can place this command anywhere within your source file but it is
      suggested that you place it within the Working-Storage Section. If you
      do this then the $DEFINE command can contain any variable definitions
      required by the macro. Otherwise you will have to either; 1) hard code
      the variables within the source file, 2) use the COPY command to load
      a copylibrary module, 3) use the $INCLUDE command to load a file that
      containing the variable definitions.

  3.2 $PREPROCESSOR

    The $PREPROCESSOR command allows you to change the default characters used
    in macro definitions and names.

    It has the following format:

      $PREPROCESSOR parameter=subparameter [, parameter=subparameter ]

    where parameter and subparameter have the following values:

      parameter    Is one of the keywords shown below. Each may be used only
                   once in a given $PREPROCESSOR command.

        KEYCHAR    Specifies the initial character of all macro names is to be
                   subparameter.

                   The default character is the % (percent).

        PARMCHAR   Specifies the initial character of all formal parameters in
                   macro definitions is to be subparameter.

                   The default character is the ! (exclamation mark).

        DELIMITER  Specifies the delimiting character in a macro string-text and
                   actual parameters is to be subparameter.

                   The default character is the # (hash).

      subparameter Is the character to be used in replacing the currently used
                   initial character or delimiter.

    Note that care must be taken when you change the initial characters and the
    string-text delimiter, because there may be cases when you use one of the
    newly defined characters in your string-text as part of the string-text
    itself, and not as a delimiter or an initial character.

    The following example shows how the $PREPROCESSOR command is used when you
    define a macro that invokes another macro (aka a Nested Macro). It is the
    only time that you should need to use the $PREPROCESSOR command.

      *> Macro ReadError(paragraph#,file-name#,file-status#)

      $define %ReadError=
      display "Error ", !3, " in paragraph ", !1, " reading file ", !2 end-display
      goback#

      $preprocessor delimiter=~

      *> Macro ReadFile(paragraph#,file-name#)

      $define %ReadFile=
      read !2 end-read

      evaluate file-status
        when read-success
          perform process-record
        when end-of-file
          perform process-eof
        when other
          *> Report the error and exit the program.
          %ReadError(!1#,!2#,file-status#)
      end-evaluate~

      $preprocessor delimiter=#

    The above example assumes the following:

    * file-status is the file status data item in the files select statement.
    * read-success is an 88 level under file-status with a value of "00".
    * end-of-file is an 88 level under file-status with a value of "10".
    * process-record is a section/paragraph performed when a record is found.
    * process-eof is a section/paragraph performed when a record is not found.

    Note: If the DELIMITER had not been changed to ~ before the define of the
    ReadFile macro then the first # character in the call to the ReadError macro
    would have been treated as the ReadFile macro terminator.

  3.3 $INCLUDE

    The $INCLUDE command allows you to specify an entire file to be read, line
    by line, into the preprocessor as part of your source file.

    It has the following format:

      $INCLUDE filename

    where filename is the name of the file, including path, whose records are to
    be read into the preprocessor.

    $INCLUDE commands may be nested to whatever depth you require. That is, the
    file that is being included may itself have a $INCLUDE command in it. The
    only limitations are the maximum file size and the available disc space for
    the preprocessed file.

    If you use this command to load macro $DEFINE commands then it is suggested
    you follow the recommendations given above for the $DEFINE command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.0 Examples

  The file Examples/Macros.inc shows some examples of how Macros are defined.

  Each example is precedded by a comment box that shows the calling syntax and
  describes the action(s) performed by the Macro.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.0 Defining and Using Macros

  The preprocessor associates a macro name with a string of text. Macros can
  have up to nine formal parameters. In the definition actual parameters are
  supplied to replace the formal parameters when the macro is called in the
  source program.

    Example:

      $DEFINE %INCA=
      ADD 1 TO ALPHA-COUNTER.
      ADD ALPHA-COUNTER TO BETA-COUNTER.
      *> Increment the values of counters alpha-counter and beta-counter.
      #

    In the above example, the entire definition of the macro, %INCA, is the
    following set of sentences:

      ADD 1 TO ALPHA-COUNTER.
      ADD ALPHA-COUNTER TO BETA-COUNTER.
      *> Increment the values of counters alpha-counter and beta-counter.

    When the $DEFINE command is processed, the string-text that makes up the
    definition of the macro is stored exactly as it appears in the command.
    All end-of-line markers and sequence numbers are saved. The only exception
    to this rule is that if all characters between the equal sign in the macro
    definition and the end of the text line in which the definition begins are
    blank, then only the end-of-line marker is saved, and the macro definition
    begins in the first column of the next line. This allows you to control the
    initial column of the macro definition without worrying about the column
    position of the macro name when it is called. Below is an illustration:

    Macro definition:

      $DEFINE %ADDIT=MOVE SPACES TO DISPLY-ITM.#
           :

    Macro call:

      DISPLAY DISPLY-ITM.
      %ADDIT
           :

    Expanded source code:

      DISPLAY DISPLY-ITM.
      MOVE SPACES TO DISPLY-ITM.
           :

    Because the macro definition starts on the same line as the macro name, the
    definition of the macro replaces the macro call starting in exactly the same
    column as the macro call.

    $DEFINE %CHECKIF=
    IF STAT-ITEM EQUAL "10" THEN
      PERFORM STATUS-REPORT
    END-IF#

    In this case, because the characters between the equal sign and the end of
    the line are blamks, the macro definition starts on the next line.

    Thus, when the macro call to %CHECKIF is made, the expanded source appears
    as shown below.

    Macro call:

      WRITE FILE-OUT.
      %CHECKIF

    Replacement:

      WRITE FILE-OUT.
      IF STAT-ITEM EQUAL "10" THEN
        PERFORM STATUS-REPORT
      END-IF

  Formal Parameters

    A macro definition may contain up to nine formal parameters. A formal
    parameter is designated by an exclamation point followed immediately by an
    integer from the range 1 to 9.

    Formal parameters in a macro definition are replaced by values you assign
    when you call the macro in your source program, as illustrated below.

    Source program:

      $DEFINE %PERFORM=
      PERFORM !1
        VARYING !2 FROM !3 BY !4
        UNTIL !5.#

      %PERFORM(CHEK-PARA#, CTROL#, INIT#, OFFSET#, A = B#)

    Expanded source program:

      PERFORM CHEK-PARA
        VARYING CTROL FROM INIT BY OFFSET
        UNTIL A = B.

  Macro Calls

    There are two different forms of a macro call:

      macro-name

    and

      macro-name(p1#, p2#, p3#, ..., pn#)


  Parameters

    macro-name     The name of a macro which has been previously defined in the
                   source program, using a $DEFINE command.

    p1,p2,...,pn   The actual parameters. Each of p1, p2, and so on may be
                   either a null string or any combination of characters and
                   numerals, including spaces. Each actual parameter begins with
                   the first character after a preceding comma (except p1, which
                   begins after the left parenthesis), and ends with the pound
                   sign.

    If no characters are specified for an actual parameter (that is, if an
    actual parameter is specified by "#"), then a null string replaces its
    corresponding formal parameter in the macro definition.

    Note from the above format that there can be no intervening spaces between
    the end of the macro name and the left parenthesis of the actual parameter
    list.

    The first method of calling a macro is used when the macro definition has no
    formal parameters.

    The second method must be used when formal parameters are specified in the
    definition of the macro.

    When a macro name is encountered in a source program, it is replaced by the
    associated macro definition. Any formal parameters are replaced by actual
    parameters listed in the macro call.

    With two exceptions, macro names are replaced wherever they occur in the
    source program, including quoted strings. Macro names are not expanded in a
    comment, unless the comment itself is found in a macro, and in list and
    compilation preprocessor commands (such as $CONTROL), where they are not recognized.</p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.0 Relationship of Formal to Actual Parameters

  The numeric value of a formal parameter determines which actual parameter in
  the macro call is to replace it.

  That is, for a formal parameter, !n (where n is 1 through 9), the nth actual
  parameter from the left in the macro call replaces !n, as illustrated below.

  Example 1

    Macro definition:

      $DEFINE %OPENSTATE=
      OPEN INPUT !1
      DISPLAY !2, !3 END-DISPLAY#

    Macro call:

      %OPENSTATE(FILE-IN#, "FILE STATISTICS"#, OPEN-STATS#)

    Result of macro call:

      OPEN INPUT FILE-IN
      DISPLAY "FILE STATISTICS", OPEN-STATS END-DISPLAY

  Example 2

    Macro definition:

      $DEFINE %COMPUTESUM=COMPUTE !1 = !2 + !3.#

    Macro call:

      %COMPUTESUM(INCREMEN#, OFFSETTER#, 7#)

    Result of macro call:

      COMPUTE INCREMEN = OFFSETTER + 7.

    In the Example 2 above, !3 is replaced by the third parameter in the macro
    call, which is 7; !2 is replaced by the second parameter, OFFSETTER, and !1
    is replaced by the first parameter in the call, INCREMEN.

    For a given macro definition, if there is a formal parameter, '!n', and if
    there are less than 'n' actual parameters in the macro call, then any formal
    parameter whose numeric value is greater than the number of parameters in
    the macro call is ignored. This is illustrated in the following example.

  Example 3

    Macro definition:

      $DEFINE %SHOWIT=DISPLAY !1, !2, !3, !5.#

    Macro call:

      %SHOWIT("A"#, " WORD "#, "IS "#, "MISSING"#)

    Result of macro call:

      DISPLAY "A", " WORD ", "IS ", .

    When you specify a formal parameter in a macro definition, you can choose
    not to use it in the macro call by entering only a comma and a hash sign in
    the appropriate position within the macro call. This is shown in the next
    example.

  Example 4

    Macro definition:

      $DEFINE %INITSTUFF=
      IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
      PROGRAM-ID. !1
      AUTHOR. !2
      DATE-COMPILED. !3#

    Macro call:

      %INITSTUFF(MACRO-TEST.#, #, Not Yet.#)

    Result of macro call:

      IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
      PROGRAM-ID. MACRO-TEST.
      AUTHOR.
      DATE-COMPILED. Not Yet.

    The second actual parameter was specified as ", #". When the replacement
    code is processed, no author name was supplied.

    The format for a macro definition assures that the initial column of each
    line in the macro definition maps onto the same column when the macro
    definition is inserted into the source program at macro call time. This
    could cause a wraparound of the replacement text when actual parameters are
    substituted in the definition.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.0 Hewlett-Packard e3000 Preprocessor Commands


  The following e3000 Preprocessor Commands are not supported by CobolMac and
  will automatically be removed from the source file.

  7.1 $CONTROL

    The $CONTROL command is used to control compilation and list options.

    It has the following format:

      $CONTROL [option [, option]...]

    where option is one or more valid options, each separated from the preceding
    option by a comma and zero or more optional spaces.

    A $CONTROL command may appear anywhere in the source text.

  7.2 $COPYRIGHT

    The $COPYRIGHT command is used to enter a copyright string into your object
    file.

    It has the following format:

      $COPYRIGHT [string [, string]...]

    where string is the data to be placed into the object file. The characters
    of string must be preceded and followed by a quotation mark. The total
    number of characters used in the strings is limited to 116. This includes
    any blanks appearing in strings, but does not include the quotation marks
    used to delimit the strings.

    A $COPYRIGHT command may appear anywhere in the source text but is normally
    placed at the beginning. Only the last $COPYRIGHT command in the source file
    will be used.

  7.3 $IF

    The $IF command is used to interrogate the compilation software switches
    (see the $SET command for additional information).

    It has the following format:

      $IF [Xn= {ON }]
          [    {OFF}]

    where n is an integer in the range 0 through 9.

    A $IF command may appear anywhere in the source text. The appearance of an
    $IF command with/without a parameter terminates the influence of any
    preceding $IF command.

  7.4 $PAGE

    The $PAGE command allows you to replace the first line of the title portion
    of the standard page heading in a listfile, and to advance to the next
    logical page of the listfile.

    It has the following format:

      $PAGE [string [, string]...]

    where string is the data to be used in replacing the first line of the
    title. The characters of string must be preceded and followed by a quotation
    mark. The total number of characters used in the strings is limited to 97.
    This includes any blanks appearing in strings, but does not include the
    quotation marks used to delimit the strings.

    A $PAGE command may appear anywhere in the source text. The appearance of a
    $PAGE command without a parameter does not change the first line of the
    title.

  7.5 $SET

    The $SET command is used to turn compilation software switches on/off.

    It has the following format:

      $SET [Xn={ON } [, Xn={ON }]...]
           [   {OFF} [     {OFF}]   ]

    where n is an integer in the range 0 through 9.

    Initially, all compilation switches are set to OFF.

    A $SET command may appear anywhere in the source text. The appearance of a
    $SET command without a parameter sets all switches to OFF.

  7.6 $TITLE

    The $TITLE command is similar to the $PAGE command in that it can be used to
    replace the first line of a title in the listfile. However, it can also be
    used to replace the second line of the title as well as the first, or only
    the second line. Unlike the $PAGE command, it does no page advancement on
    the logical page of the listfile.

    It has the following format:

      $TITLE [ (n) ] [string [, string ]...]

    where n is an integer specifying which line of the title (1 or 2) is to be
    replaced. string has the same format, restrictions and use as in the $PAGE
    command.

    A $TITLE command may appear anywhere in the source text. The appearance of a
    $TITLE command without any parameters clears the first line of the title.

  7.7 $VERSION

    The $VERSION command is used to enter a version string into your object file.

    It has the following format:

      $VERSION [string [, string]...]

    where string is the data to be placed into the object file. The characters
    of string must be preceded and followed by a quotation mark (") or an
    apostrophe ('). The total number of characters used in the strings is
    limited to 255. This includes any blanks appearing in strings, but does not
    include the quotation marks used to delimit the strings.

    A $VERSION command may appear anywhere in the source text but is normally
    placed at the beginning. Only the last $VERSION command in the source file
    will be used. Use the program /SYS/PUB/VERSION to display the version
    strings.
