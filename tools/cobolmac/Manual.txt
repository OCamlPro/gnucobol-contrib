1.0  Description

  CobolMac is a COBOL Macro Preprocessor utility that reads a COBOL source file
  prior to processing by GnuCOBOL's Compiler.

  It is implemented as a command-line filter that emulates the Macro capability
  available with the Hewlett-Packard e3000 COBOL II/iX Compiler.

  It allows the user to define pre-written code which is incorporated into the
  source code. Macros can have up to nine formal parameters. In the definition
  actual parameters are supplied to replace the formal parameters when the macro
  is called in the source program.

  A good library of pre-tested Macros can greatly speed program writing, and can
  also be used to assist portability of code, with the differences between COBOL
  dialects being hidden in the Macro Definitions.

  In Don Nelson's "COBOL 85 for Programmers", he says about the COPY...REPLACING
  & REPLACE statements:

    "The rules are complex and are actually ambiguous in some cases."

  Right there, that's something of a warning, and he goes on to say much about
  behaviors to beware of. He also warns that "One problem is that only words are
  replaced, not parts of words."

  Note: If used to preprocess FIXED FORMAT files then extra care must be taken
        when defining the macros to ensure that all added code resides in the
        correct areas - Area A (cols 7 to 11) and Area B (cols 12 to 72).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.0  Program Usage

  Usage:
    $ cobolmac [options] <input >output [2>messages]
    $ cobolmac [options] <input [2>messages] | program2
    $ program1 | cobolmac [options] [2>messages] | program2

  Options:
    -h, --help     Display this text and exit.
    -v, --version  Display the preprocessor version and exit.
    -H, --hardwarn Treat all warnings like an error.
    -V, --verbose  Include Macro Begin/End comment lines.
    -d, --debug    Display additional error information.
    -m, --maclib   List the contents of the Macro Library.
    -sfilename, --stdlib=filename
                   [path/]name of file containing Standard Macros Library.

    input          [path/]name of file Standard Input redirected to.
    output         [path/]name of file Standard Output redirected to.
    messages       optional [path/]name of file Standard Error redirected to.
    program1       [path/]name of program that writes to Standard Output.
    program2       [path/]name of program that reads from Standard Input.

  Return Codes:
    0 (zero)       Program completed without any errors.
    1 (one)        Program terminated in an error state.
                   Details written to Standard Error prior to termination.
                   The output file, if created, is incomplete/corrupt.

  Note: The Standard Output from CobolMac can be piped directly to GnuCOBOL so
        the preprocessed source can be compiled. This method negates the need
        for a permenant file to hold the preprocessed source.

        Replace 'program2' with 'cobc -x /dev/stdin -o object' where '-x' is the
        required GnuCOBOL options, and 'object' is the [path/]name for the
        compiled program/module.

  Note: Missing CBL_OC_GETOPT work-around.

        CobolMac B.02.00 replaced its home-grown command line option processing
        with calls to the CBL_OC_GETOPT system routine. This was fine for those
        who had a revision of GnuCOBOL 2.0 that contained it.

        Those who had earlier revisions or Report-Writer or OpenCOBOL found they
        were unable to use CobolMac as it would abort.

        To fix this problem I have added the home-grown processing and some
        additional code to invoke it if the call to CBL_OC_GETOPT fails. Due to
        limitations within the home-grown code it is unable to handle either the
        --stdlib or -s options.

        A message will be displayed on stderr if the home-grown code is invoked.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1  Standard Macros Library

  At some point you will find yourself $DEFINEing and using a standard set of
  macros. When this happens you can add the $DEFINE commands into a file named
  'cobolmac.standard.macros' and CobolMac will automatically add it to the start
  of the source programs Working-Storage Section.

  The reason for placing the contents of 'cobolmac.standard.macros' within the
  Working-Storage Section is so you can also include any variable definitions
  that are specific to the macros.

  The file cobolmac.standard.macros is assumed to reside in the current working
  directory. The --stdlib (-s) option can be used to point CobolMac to a library
  file with a different name and/or in a different location.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.0  CobolMac Commands

  The following commands are supported by the CobolMac Preprocessor.

  3.1  $DEFINE

    The $DEFINE command is used to associate a string of text with a macro name.
    When the preprocessor encounters a defined macro name in the source program,
    it invokes the macro and passes the associated string of text.

    SYNTAX

      The $DEFINE command has the following format:

      $DEFINE %macro-name=[string-text]#

    PARAMETERS

      macro-name   the name of the macro being defined.

                   macro-name is limited to a length of 30 characters and is,
                   by default, prefixed by a '%' (percent).

      string-text  a string of text to replace occurrences of the macro call
                   within the body of the program code.

                   Can be any text you choose. However, because this text is
                   sent to the compiler, it must be a valid COBOL statement or
                   sentence, with one exception. This exception is the use of
                   formal parameters in the string-text. Formal parameters are
                   described later in this section.

                   string-text may contain formal parameters (referred to as
                   variables). They are designated by an integer in the range 1
                   to 9 that are, by default, prefixed by an '!' (exclamation).

    DESCRIPTION

      This command may appear anywhere in your source program.

      The $DEFINE command is, by default, terminated by a '#' (hash).

      Nested $DEFINE commands and recursive macros are not supported.

      The macro-name prefix, formal parameter prefix and $DEFINE terminator can
      be changed by using the $PREPROCESSOR command (see below).

  3.2  $PREPROCESSOR

    The $PREPROCESSOR command allows you to change the default character used in
    the macro definitions and names.

    SYNTAX

      The $PREPROCESSOR command has the following format:

        $PREPROCESSOR parameter=new-char [, ...]

    PARAMETERS

      parameter    is one of the following:

                     KEYCHAR     the macro-name prefix character.
                                 The default character is % (percent).

                     PARMCHAR    the formal parameter prefix character used
                                 within the macro text-string.

                                 The default character is ! (exclamation).

                     DELIMITER   the character that delimits the end of macro
                                 text strings and the actual parameters used
                                 with macro calls.

                                 The default character is # (hash).

      new-char     specifies the new character to be used for the specified
                   parameter.

    DESCRIPTION

      You must ensure that any parameter you change does not contain a character
      that will appear in the $DEFINE text-string. If it does then processing of
      the $DEFINE will terminated early or give unexpected results.

      The following example shows how the $PREPROCESSOR command is used when you
      define a macro that invokes another macro (aka a Nested Macro). It is the
      only time that you should need to use the $PREPROCESSOR command.

        *> Macro ReadError(paragraph#,file-name#,file-status#)

        $define %ReadError=
        display
          "Error ", !3, " in paragraph ", !1, " reading file ", !2
        end-display
        goback#

        *> Change the macro delimiter to something other than #. If this is not
        *> done then the first # character in the call to the %ReadError macro
        *> will be treated as the %ReadFile macro terminator.

        $preprocessor delimiter=~

        *> Macro ReadFile(paragraph#,file-name#)

        $define %ReadFile=
        read !2 end-read
        evaluate file-status
          when read-success
            perform process-record
          when end-of-file
            perform process-eof
          when other *> Report the error and exit the program.
            %ReadError(!1#,!2#,file-status#)
        end-evaluate~

        *> Return the macro define terminator to its default value.

        $preprocessor delimiter=#

      The above example assumes the following:

        * file-status is a pic x(2) data item assigned to the FILE STATUS option
          in the files SELECT statement.
        * read-success is an 88 level under file-status with a value of "00".
        * end-of-file is an 88 level under file-status with a value of "10".
        * process-record and process-eof is an existing section/paragraph.

  3.3  $INCLUDE

    The $INCLUDE command allows you to specify a file to be copied into your
    source program.

    SYNTAX

      The $INCLUDE command has the following format:

        $INCLUDE filename

    PARAMETERS

      filename     the name of the file, including path, to be copied into your
                   source program.

    DESCRIPTION

      This command may appear anywhere in your source program.

      $INCLUDE commands may be nested to whatever depth you require. That is,
      the file that is being copied may itself have $INCLUDE commands in it.

      If you use this command to load macro $DEFINE commands then its suggested
      you follow the recommendations given above for the $DEFINE command.

  3.4  $COPY [note: this command has not yet been implemented]

    The $COPY command allows you to specify a copybook module, held in a library
    file, to be copied into your source program.

    SYNTAX

      The $COPY command has the following format:

        $COPY copybook IN|OF library

    PARAMETERS

      copybook     the name of the module to be copied into your source program.

      library      the name of the library file, including path, in which the
                   module to be copied resides. DO NOT include a file extension.

                   library must be an indexed file, with the .cpylib extension,
                   that was created by the cpylibeditor program.

    DESCRIPTION

      This command may appear anywhere in your source program.

      This command does not currently allow the use of the REPLACING...BY phrase
      that is available with the COPY statement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.0  Examples

  The file Examples/Macros.inc shows some examples of how Macros are defined.

  Each example is precedded by a comment box that shows the calling syntax and
  describes the action(s) performed by the Macro.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.0  Defining and Using Macros

  The preprocessor associates a macro name with a string of text. Macros can
  have up to nine formal parameters. In the definition actual parameters are
  supplied to replace the formal parameters when the macro is called in the
  source program.

    Example:

      $DEFINE %INCA=
      ADD 1 TO ALPHA-COUNTER.
      ADD ALPHA-COUNTER TO BETA-COUNTER.
      *> Increment the values of counters alpha-counter and beta-counter.
      #

    In the above example, the entire definition of the macro, %INCA, is the
    following set of sentences:

      ADD 1 TO ALPHA-COUNTER.
      ADD ALPHA-COUNTER TO BETA-COUNTER.
      *> Increment the values of counters alpha-counter and beta-counter.

    When the $DEFINE command is processed, the string-text that makes up the
    definition of the macro is stored exactly as it appears in the command.
    All end-of-line markers and sequence numbers are saved. The only exception
    to this rule is that if all characters between the equal sign in the macro
    definition and the end of the text line in which the definition begins are
    blank, then only the end-of-line marker is saved, and the macro definition
    begins in the first column of the next line. This allows you to control the
    initial column of the macro definition without worrying about the column
    position of the macro name when it is called. Below is an illustration:

    Macro definition:

      $DEFINE %ADDIT=MOVE SPACES TO DISPLY-ITM.#
           :

    Macro call:

      DISPLAY DISPLY-ITM.
      %ADDIT
           :

    Expanded source code:

      DISPLAY DISPLY-ITM.
      MOVE SPACES TO DISPLY-ITM.
           :

    Because the macro definition starts on the same line as the macro name, the
    definition of the macro replaces the macro call starting in exactly the same
    column as the macro call.

    $DEFINE %CHECKIF=
    IF STAT-ITEM EQUAL "10" THEN
      PERFORM STATUS-REPORT
    END-IF#

    In this case, because the characters between the equal sign and the end of
    the line are blamks, the macro definition starts on the next line.

    Thus, when the macro call to %CHECKIF is made, the expanded source appears
    as shown below.

    Macro call:

      WRITE FILE-OUT.
      %CHECKIF

    Replacement:

      WRITE FILE-OUT.
      IF STAT-ITEM EQUAL "10" THEN
        PERFORM STATUS-REPORT
      END-IF

  Formal Parameters

    A macro definition may contain up to nine formal parameters. A formal
    parameter is designated by an exclamation point followed immediately by an
    integer from the range 1 to 9.

    Formal parameters in a macro definition are replaced by values you assign
    when you call the macro in your source program, as illustrated below.

    Source program:

      $DEFINE %PERFORM=
      PERFORM !1
        VARYING !2 FROM !3 BY !4
        UNTIL !5.#

      %PERFORM(CHEK-PARA#, CTROL#, INIT#, OFFSET#, A = B#)

    Expanded source program:

      PERFORM CHEK-PARA
        VARYING CTROL FROM INIT BY OFFSET
        UNTIL A = B.

  Macro Calls

    There are two different forms of a macro call:

      macro-name

    and

      macro-name(p1#, p2#, p3#, ..., pn#)


  Parameters

    macro-name     The name of a macro which has been previously defined in the
                   source program, using a $DEFINE command.

    p1,p2,...,pn   The actual parameters. Each of p1, p2, and so on may be
                   either a null string or any combination of characters and
                   numerals, including spaces. Each actual parameter begins with
                   the first character after a preceding comma (except p1, which
                   begins after the left parenthesis), and ends with the pound
                   sign.

    If no characters are specified for an actual parameter (that is, if an
    actual parameter is specified by "#"), then a null string replaces its
    corresponding formal parameter in the macro definition.

    Note from the above format that there can be no intervening spaces between
    the end of the macro name and the left parenthesis of the actual parameter
    list.

    The first method of calling a macro is used when the macro definition has no
    formal parameters.

    The second method must be used when formal parameters are specified in the
    definition of the macro.

    When a macro name is encountered in a source program, it is replaced by the
    associated macro definition. Any formal parameters are replaced by actual
    parameters listed in the macro call.

    With two exceptions, macro names are replaced wherever they occur in the
    source program, including quoted strings. Macro names are not expanded in a
    comment, unless the comment itself is found in a macro, and in list and
    compilation preprocessor commands (such as $CONTROL), where they are not
    recognized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.0  Relationship of Formal to Actual Parameters

  The numeric value of a formal parameter determines which actual parameter in
  the macro call is to replace it.

  That is, for a formal parameter, !n (where n is 1 through 9), the nth actual
  parameter from the left in the macro call replaces !n, as illustrated below.

  Example 1

    Macro definition:

      $DEFINE %OPENSTATE=
      OPEN INPUT !1
      DISPLAY !2, !3 END-DISPLAY#

    Macro call:

      %OPENSTATE(FILE-IN#, "FILE STATISTICS"#, OPEN-STATS#)

    Result of macro call:

      OPEN INPUT FILE-IN
      DISPLAY "FILE STATISTICS", OPEN-STATS END-DISPLAY

  Example 2

    Macro definition:

      $DEFINE %COMPUTESUM=COMPUTE !1 = !2 + !3.#

    Macro call:

      %COMPUTESUM(INCREMEN#, OFFSETTER#, 7#)

    Result of macro call:

      COMPUTE INCREMEN = OFFSETTER + 7.

    In the Example 2 above, !3 is replaced by the third parameter in the macro
    call, which is 7; !2 is replaced by the second parameter, OFFSETTER, and !1
    is replaced by the first parameter in the call, INCREMEN.

    For a given macro definition, if there is a formal parameter, '!n', and if
    there are less than 'n' actual parameters in the macro call, then any formal
    parameter whose numeric value is greater than the number of parameters in
    the macro call is ignored. This is illustrated in the following example.

  Example 3

    Macro definition:

      $DEFINE %SHOWIT=DISPLAY !1, !2, !3, !5.#

    Macro call:

      %SHOWIT("A"#, " WORD "#, "IS "#, "MISSING"#)

    Result of macro call:

      DISPLAY "A", " WORD ", "IS ", .

    When you specify a formal parameter in a macro definition, you can choose
    not to use it in the macro call by entering only a comma and a hash sign in
    the appropriate position within the macro call. This is shown in the next
    example.

  Example 4

    Macro definition:

      $DEFINE %INITSTUFF=
      IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
      PROGRAM-ID. !1
      AUTHOR. !2
      DATE-COMPILED. !3#

    Macro call:

      %INITSTUFF(MACRO-TEST.#, #, Not Yet.#)

    Result of macro call:

      IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
      PROGRAM-ID. MACRO-TEST.
      AUTHOR.
      DATE-COMPILED. Not Yet.

    The second actual parameter was specified as ", #". When the replacement
    code is processed, no author name was supplied.

    The format for a macro definition assures that the initial column of each
    line in the macro definition maps onto the same column when the macro
    definition is inserted into the source program at macro call time. This
    could cause a wraparound of the replacement text when actual parameters are
    substituted in the definition.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.0  Installation

  7.1  Requirements

    GnuCOBOL 2.0 (or greater) package installed and tested fully working. See
    documentation supplied with GnuCOBOL. You MUST have run both sanity checks
    created by the test procedures including within the cobol85 suite as well as
    the make check procedure.

  7.2  Configuration

    CobolMac supports multiple operating systems.

    Prior to compiling CobolMac you must set the value of the CDF variable named
    OS to the required value (see the 'Configuration Settings' comments in the
    source file header for details).

      'LINUX'   for a GNU/Linux version
      'UNIX'    for a UNIX version
      'OSX'     for a Mac OSX version
      'WINDOWS' for a Windows version
      'CYGWIN'  for a Windows/Cygwin version
      'MINGW'   for a Windows/MinGW version

  7.3  Temporary File Location

    The following logic is used to find the location where the temporary files,
    used by this program, are to be placed.

    * Check the TMPDIR environment variable.
      If it exists and contains a value then use it else continue.

    * Check the TEMP environment variable.
      If it exists and contains a value then use it else continue.

    * Check the TMP environment variable.
      If it exists and contains a value then use it else continue.

    * If running on a Windows (Native, Cygwin, or MinGW) platform then ...

      * Check the USERPROFILE environment variable.
        If it exists and contains a value then use it else use "." (dot).

    * If not running on a Windows platform then use "/tmp".

    Note: This may change when GnuCOBOL 2.0 becomes the official release.

  7.4  Directory Seperator

    The directory separator is platform dependent. The character used is set by
    value of the CDF variable named OS as follows:

      / (slash) for GNU/Linux, UNIX, Mac OSX and Windows/Cygwin.

      \ (backslash) for Windows and Windows/MinGW.

  7.5  Compiling

    7.5.1  Linux/Unix

      Compile the source of cobolmac.cob with the command:

        ./comp-cobolmac.sh

      at a command prompt using any terminal program.

      Now place cobolmac in a directory that is within the PATH making sure that
      the execute flag is set (chmod +x cobolmac) although this is done within
      the script.

    7.5.2  Mac OSX

      Compile the source file as for Linux/Unix.

      In the event this does not work, you must have installed and tested
      GnuCOBOL.

      Note this might not work 'as is' with Tiny Cobol or ANY other compiler.
      Check to see if the compiler supports the C$DELETE built-in system
      subroutine. If not then the s022-delete-workfiles paragraph will need
      modification to perform this function some other way (for eg. drop into a
      command shell and issue the file delete/purge commands).

    7.5.3  Windows

      I do not have access to Windows, Wingows/Cygwin and Windows/MinGW but I
      understand that the following commands should work [YMMV]:

        Windows/MinGW and Windows/Cygwin (inside the terminal program):

          Use the command ./comp-cobolmac.sh at the command prompt.

        Windows/MinGW and Windows/Cygwin (outside the terminal program):

          cobc -x [drive:][path/to/]cobolmac.cob

        Native Windows:

          cobc -x [drive:][path\to\]cobolmac.cob

8.0  Hewlett-Packard e3000 Preprocessor Commands


  The following e3000 Preprocessor Commands are not supported by CobolMac and
  will automatically be removed from the source file.

  8.1  $CONTROL

    The $CONTROL command is used to control compilation and list options.

    It has the following format:

      $CONTROL [option [, option]...]

    where option is one or more valid options, each separated from the preceding
    option by a comma and zero or more optional spaces.

    A $CONTROL command may appear anywhere in the source text.

  8.2  $COPYRIGHT

    The $COPYRIGHT command is used to enter a copyright string into your object
    file.

    It has the following format:

      $COPYRIGHT [string [, string]...]

    where string is the data to be placed into the object file. The characters
    of string must be preceded and followed by a quotation mark. The total
    number of characters used in the strings is limited to 116. This includes
    any blanks appearing in strings, but does not include the quotation marks
    used to delimit the strings.

    A $COPYRIGHT command may appear anywhere in the source text but is normally
    placed at the beginning. Only the last $COPYRIGHT command in the source file
    will be used.

  8.3  $IF

    The $IF command is used to interrogate the compilation software switches
    (see the $SET command for additional information).

    It has the following format:

      $IF [Xn= {ON }]
          [    {OFF}]

    where n is an integer in the range 0 through 9.

    A $IF command may appear anywhere in the source text. The appearance of an
    $IF command with/without a parameter terminates the influence of any
    preceding $IF command.

  8.4  $PAGE

    The $PAGE command allows you to replace the first line of the title portion
    of the standard page heading in a listfile, and to advance to the next
    logical page of the listfile.

    It has the following format:

      $PAGE [string [, string]...]

    where string is the data to be used in replacing the first line of the
    title. The characters of string must be preceded and followed by a quotation
    mark. The total number of characters used in the strings is limited to 97.
    This includes any blanks appearing in strings, but does not include the
    quotation marks used to delimit the strings.

    A $PAGE command may appear anywhere in the source text. The appearance of a
    $PAGE command without a parameter does not change the first line of the
    title.

  8.5  $SET

    The $SET command is used to turn compilation software switches on/off.

    It has the following format:

      $SET [Xn={ON } [, Xn={ON }]...]
           [   {OFF} [     {OFF}]   ]

    where n is an integer in the range 0 through 9.

    Initially, all compilation switches are set to OFF.

    A $SET command may appear anywhere in the source text. The appearance of a
    $SET command without a parameter sets all switches to OFF.

  8.6  $TITLE

    The $TITLE command is similar to the $PAGE command in that it can be used to
    replace the first line of a title in the listfile. However, it can also be
    used to replace the second line of the title as well as the first, or only
    the second line. Unlike the $PAGE command, it does no page advancement on
    the logical page of the listfile.

    It has the following format:

      $TITLE [ (n) ] [string [, string ]...]

    where n is an integer specifying which line of the title (1 or 2) is to be
    replaced. string has the same format, restrictions and use as in the $PAGE
    command.

    A $TITLE command may appear anywhere in the source text. The appearance of a
    $TITLE command without any parameters clears the first line of the title.

  8.7  $VERSION

    The $VERSION command is used to enter a version string into your object file.

    It has the following format:

      $VERSION [string [, string]...]

    where string is the data to be placed into the object file. The characters
    of string must be preceded and followed by a quotation mark (") or an
    apostrophe ('). The total number of characters used in the strings is
    limited to 255. This includes any blanks appearing in strings, but does not
    include the quotation marks used to delimit the strings.

    A $VERSION command may appear anywhere in the source text but is normally
    placed at the beginning. Only the last $VERSION command in the source file
    will be used. Use the program /SYS/PUB/VERSION to display the version
    strings.
