There is a complete accounting system called ACAS available that supports:

General/Nominal ledger processing in the names of IRS and General (handles
profit centers and branch accounting) although both can be processed within IRS
by making use of the sub-nominal account numbers to break down both.

Sales Ledger (Receivables) including invoicing and payment processing to name
but a few.

Purchase Ledger (Payables) including automatic payment processing as well as
manual payment processing.

Stock Control (Inventory) support service type items as well as item bought for
sale utilising Sales Ledger.

The Cobol code for this system is around 500,000 lines of Cobol code plus some
code written in C / C++.

You can find this system also on sourceforge.net, as acas at :
sourceforge.net/p/acas

I will not be placing it here as it will be just another area that I have to
keep up to date etc.
