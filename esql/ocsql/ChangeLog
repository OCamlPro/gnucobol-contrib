	* Memory leak fix introduced on 2021-11-14.

	* We need to clear the reference to prepared statement from COBOL memory (SQL_IPTR)
	*  in order to be able to handle reconnect when connection was lost (switch to failover).
	* Otherwise we will have invalid reference to prepared statement.
	* In this case we can not CANCEL COBOL ESQL programs as the reference to COBOL memory will be invalid.
	* So define CANCEL_IS_USED if you need to CANCEL COBOL ESQL programs, which is highly NOT recommended.

	* Fixed extremely heavy bug for EXEC SQL CALL with COMP-3 parameters
	* It's been implemented cordially wrong for DECIMAL
	* It is still the issue for INOUT parameters at least for SQL Server 2012
	* I hope Microsoft resolved that in the latest versions, but I can't confirm.
	* Also fixed BufferSize issue for VARCHAR (both OUTPUT and INOUT).
